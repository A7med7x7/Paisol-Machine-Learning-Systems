# PAISOL: Machine Learning Internship Tasks

Welcome to the PAISOL Machine Learning Internship repository! This repository contains the tasks and corresponding code implementations for the Machine Learning internship program.

## Update your LinkedIn profiles.

For the Machine Learning internship, you will need to complete at least 5 tasks for successful completion of the internship. Maintain a separate GitHub repository (named as PAISOL for all the tasks and share the link of the GitHub repo in the task submission form(it will be given later through email).

## Task Descriptions

### Task 1: Sentiment Analysis with NLP

Develop a model to analyze and predict sentiment from text data.

Requirements:
- Use a dataset of text with labeled sentiment.
- Implement NLP techniques to process text data.
- Train a model to classify sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.
- Document the development process and model performance.

Outcome: A sentiment analysis model with high accuracy.

### Task 2: Time Series Forecasting

Create a model to forecast future data points in a time series.

Requirements:
- Utilize a historical dataset with time-stamped entries.
- Apply ARIMA, LSTM, or other suitable models for forecasting.
- Evaluate the model’s predictive accuracy.
- Write a report on the methodology and results.

Outcome: An effective time series forecasting model.

### Task 3: Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic

Build a system to detect unusual patterns in network traffic.

Requirements:
- Gather a dataset of network traffic with labeled anomalies.
- Implement unsupervised learning algorithms for detection.
- Test the system’s detection rate and false positives.
- Summarize the approach and findings in a report.

Outcome: A network anomaly detection system.

### Task 4: Recommender System Development

Construct a recommender system for e-commerce or media content.

Requirements:
- Collect user interaction data with products or media.
- Choose collaborative filtering or content-based methods.
- Assess the system’s recommendation relevance.
- Detail the creation process and user feedback.

Outcome: A personalized recommender system.

### Task 5: Handwriting Recognition

Develop a model to recognize and interpret handwritten text.

Requirements:
- Use a dataset of handwritten samples for training.
- Implement neural networks to decipher handwriting.
- Evaluate the model’s accuracy and error rate.
- Report on the challenges and solutions in development.

Outcome: A handwriting recognition model.

### Task 6: Speech-to-Text Conversion

Create a system to convert spoken language into text.

Requirements:
- Collect a diverse set of voice recordings for training.
- Use speech recognition algorithms for conversion.
- Test the system’s accuracy across different accents.
- Compile a report on the system’s performance.

Outcome: A speech-to-text conversion system.

## Data Sets

Links to the datasets for each task will be provided within the respective task descriptions.
